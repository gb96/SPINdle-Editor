Building from source
--------------------
The SPINdle Editor build system is based on Jakarta Ant, and is rely on a 
build file written in XML as building instructions.  For more information 
please refer to "http://ant.apache.org".

1. Third-party library used:
   SPINdle uses JDOM (ver1.1) for XML document parsing.  License details 
   can be found from the JDOM library package.
   
   SPINdle Editor uses SWT for its user interface generation, which 
   is distributed under the terms of the Eclipse Public License 
   (see http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php for details).
   
   In the SPINdle package, you should find the following jar files under 
   the <SPINdleEditor_HOME>/lib folder:
   + JDOM (ver1.1)
     - jdom.jar
   + SWT (ver3.4)
     - org.eclipse.core.commands_<version>.jar
     - org.eclipse.equinox.common_<version>.jar
     - org.eclipse.jface_<version>.jar
     - org.eclipse.ui.workbench_<version>.jar
     - org.eclipse.osgi_<version>.jar

If everything is right and all the required library is visible, you can 
then type:
        ant dist
to compile the source code and archive it as an executable jar file.        
      
        
2. Build targets
The build system is not responsible for compiling SPINdle into a jar file,
but also responsible for creating JavaDoc documentations and other tasks,
such as:
compile - compiles the source code (ONLY).
dist    - compile the source code and archive it as an executable jar file.
run     - run the editor.
javadoc - generates the API documentation in ./docs/api.
clean   - restore the distribution to its original and clean state.

For example, to build the samples, type
        ant compile
to generate the API documentation, type
        ant javadoc

To learn the details of what each target does, please read the build.xml
file.

NOTE: For Mac user who wants to run the editor in command prompt please add
      a JVM argument "-XstartOnFirstThread" in the command line.  A script
      "run.sh" is created for you so that you can execute the editor directly
      without using ant.
